I would like to be able to mix and match them. That is, I would like to have a set of raw sources
and a 'recipe' list, then run a tool to build a combined tileset image.

About Tilesets.   
<br>


I would like to be able to mix and match them.
That is, I would like to have a set of raw sources
and a 'recipe' list,
then run a tool to build a combined tileset image.
<br>

It might be more structured to combine this with
a json tag index of the tiles,
so the raw container image is accompanied by
indexed name tags.
<br>

This would avoid having to hardcode the positions or indices
of the individual tiles, which would be likely to
jumble around as you update the selected subset.
<br>

Ironically, the things I appear to want to do here,
appear to be already supported by the popular free tool
<br>

Tiled (Tile-D/Til-ED).
<br>


------------
<br>

Anyway, for actual tiles, the priority 
would be an 'empty floor grid square', 
ie probably with some kind of vague grid border visible.
A priority for the 'empty floor' is,
that is should be as inconspicious and not-noisy as possible.
<br>

The second priority would be some kind of wall/rock thing,
which should be able to tile in a pleasant way
(ie, when you use it for longer clustered sections of wall).
<br>

The third priority would be any kind of resource or object,
e.g. "pacman pills to gather".
<br>

A priority at the same level would be some kind of 'goal marker'
/ prized item/treasure (something less common than the
'pacman pills').
<br>

Next, one might _consider_ creatures, mobs, npcs or player
of some kind, but those don't really necessarily belong in the
tilemap as such, they should probably be on some kind
of sprite sheet, 
unless it is all pooled together (which may make sense).
<br>

Further posibilities would be actual 'functional'
map-environment entities, like doors, traps, locks, stairs.
Things that either affect navigation or activities/abilities.
<br>

Hmm.. It appears I WILL need some kind of margin,
even if only 5px.

Also, some font-size increase.
